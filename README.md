# CV Maker

This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as part of learning web development. I am leaving these projects up and public for anyone who would want to see my journey to becoming a software engineer. 

## What I Learned

- Learned the basics of React and JSX.
- Learned how to handle state in React.
- Learned to use Vite.

## Features

- Change font and color of the CV.
- The CV will always maintain the same aspect ratio.
- Exportable as a PDF.
